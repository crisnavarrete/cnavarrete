I am a sociologist and now a DPhil in Anthropology student at the University of Oxford. My academic interests lie at the intersection of science, health, and society. I am also try to make some decent arguments in social theory and the philosophy of the social sciences.

Theoretically, my work has focused on issues of causality and realism in sociology, while my empirical research has centered on antimicrobial resistance. At Oxford I expect to look at the evolution of the production of evidence regarding industrial toxicity in Chilean sacrifice zones.

I created this page to share my research, reflections, and career updates. Comments and contact are always welcome. Posts may appear in either Spanish or English, depending on the topic and my mood. If you're interested in any of my papers, feel free to reach out. Working papers are either under-review or developed enough for me to share and discuss :)
