    "text": "I am a sociologist and Master of research in Sociology graduate from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. I am interested in the nexus between science, health, and society, but I am also passionate about social theory and the philosophy of social sciences. While my theoretical interests have led me to work on the concept of emergence in the social sciences, my empirical research focuses on antimicrobial resistance.\nI created this page to share my career and thoughts, so any contact or comments are more than welcome. Posts may be in Spanish or English, depending on the topic and my mood."
